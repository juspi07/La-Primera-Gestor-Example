# Gestor_LaPrimera
DEMO Invoice and billing manager of La Primera Bakery 

_This manager was custom made for "La Primera S.A." company_
_This is a 'father' application designed to manage and modify information from various other systems used within the company_


### Requirements üìã

- _MySQL Community Server version 8 en adelante_
- _Lector de archivos .PDF_
- _Lector de archivos .Excel_


## Installation

Make sure you have a working MySQL database and run the .sql
(where it contains the structures of the tables and some data to make it functional.) 
then configure the .ini in the user dir (example: C:\Users\..)

```bash
[DEFAULT]
db_name = schema
db_user = username
db_password = password
db_host = 127.0.0.1
db_port = 3306
```

## To Consider

The script comments and the UI language are in Spanish, and the search button in "Clientes" is disabled,
the reason behind this is due to this application not allowed to communicate with The Federal Administration of Public Income,
which was the revenue service of Argentina (AFIP), when using the DEMO version only


## Usage

Being a demo, only the "Ventas" (sales), "Clientes" (clients) and "Precio" (prices) functionalities found in the "Productos" (products) tab are enabled.
If an error occurs, a log.txt file will be generated in the user's folder containing the error details.
